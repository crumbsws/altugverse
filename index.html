        <h3>
          Crumbsnet
        </h3>
        <p>A social networking site I create using React, PHP and Websockets. Features include live messaging system, posts, reactions and live notifications. This project alowed me to experiment with Javascript web libraries and websockets. This also gave me the chance to track people's habits on social networks.</p>

          altugnet CNN and Denoiser
        </h3>
        <p>A convolutional neural network I made in Cambridge. The model was able to identify pictures from the CIFAR10 dataset. After making the model, I made some adversarial attacks on the model which were succesful and another model to denoise images.</p>

          janNet
